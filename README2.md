# Indefinite Path Finder

## Overview
This code is designed to determine if there exists an **indefinite path** in a directed graph (G), starting from a specified node, where every edge in the path meets or exceeds a given minimum weight. If such a path exists, the code returns a list of node labels, with the last label forming a cycle. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

---

## Key Functions

### `find_indefinite_path(G, start_node, min_weight)`
Determines if an indefinite path exists in the graph `G`.

#### Parameters:
- **`G`**: A directed graph object (from `DGraphHW` module).
- **`start_node`**: The starting node for the path.
- **`min_weight`**: The minimum required weight for edges in the path.

#### Process:
1. **Edge Filtering**:
   - Iterates over all edges in the graph.
   - Removes edges with weights less than `min_weight`.
2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Checks if a cycle exists starting from `start_node`.
   - If no cycle is detected, returns `None`.
   - If a cycle is found, extracts and returns the path forming the cycle.

#### Returns:
- A list of node labels representing the cycle if an indefinite path exists.
- `None` if no such path exists.

---

### `findInital(start_node, end1, end2)`
This is an incomplete helper function that:
- Prints edges in the graph.
- Appears to explore paths starting from `start_node`.

#### Parameters:
- **`start_node`**: The starting node.
- **`end1`, `end2`**: Additional parameters (unused in the function body).

#### Returns:
- Currently returns `None`.

## Graph Input
- The graph is loaded from a file named `roads.txt`.
- The file should contain graph data in JSON format.

Example:
```json
{
  "nodes": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "a", "target": "b", "weight": 100},
    {"source": "b", "target": "c", "weight": 80},
    {"source": "c", "target": "a", "weight": 50}
  ]
}
```

---

## Required Module: `DGraphHW`
The code relies on a custom graph library `DGraphHW`, which provides:
- **`DGraph` class**: Represents the directed graph.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getEdgeSet()`: Returns the set of edges as tuples.
  - `getEdgeWeight(u, v)`: Returns the weight of the edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
  - `removeEdge(u, v)`: Removes the edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
  - `detect_cycle(start_node)`: Detects and returns a cycle starting from `start_node`.
  - `loadJSON(data)`: Loads graph data from a JSON string.

---

## Example Execution
1. Create a graph object:
   ```python
   G = DG.DGraph()
   f = open('roads.txt', 'r')
   G.loadJSON(f.read())
   ```

2. Find an indefinite path:
   ```python
   print("Indefinite path is ", str(find_indefinite_path(G, 'a', 50)))
   ```

3. Use the incomplete `findInital` function:
   ```python
   print(str(findInital('e', 'o', 'f')))
   ```

---

## Notes and Limitations
- The **`findInital` function** is incomplete and currently only prints edges in the graph.
- The graph `G` is **modified in-place** during execution of `find_indefinite_path`.
- The file `roads.txt` must be present and contain valid JSON-formatted graph data.
- The code does not handle errors such as missing nodes or invalid inputs.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Complete the `findInital` function to implement its intended functionality.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs and file formats.
- Optimize cycle detection and edge filtering for large graphs.
